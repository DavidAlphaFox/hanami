Hey guys, I'm pleased to announce a couple slightly late holiday gifts. But, they both have several very cool new capabilities and features.

The first is version 0.5.1 of Hanami https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami, the go to lib/(optional) framework for developing your Vega/Vega-Lite powered domain specific visualization applications. This version provides support for chartless/empty picture frames enabling full hiccup/re-com enabled text based areas. These can be used in tab layouts just like frameless charts/plots/layouts and those with standard picture frames. All can be mixed together in a given tab 'page'. New file based data sources covering `clj`, `edn`, `json`, and `csv`. This supplements the previous `values`, `url`, and `named channel` data sources. Stronger and more general support for application specific routes and landing pages. New template support for tree layouts - the first of several new network/graph layouts to come. New (experimental) template for overview+detail.

Also, very important, there is a _major_ documentation upgrade! With more coming as I force some of my cycles to complete at least a first draft for all sections.

The second is version 0.3.2 of Saite https://github.com/jsa-aerial/saite. Saite started out as a fairly simple exploratory graphics and visualization application (built on Hanami) but now is evolving toward a new highly capable notebook. This version provides several cool new capabilities, including CodeMirror editors for JS/JSON and Clj, bidirectional conversions, quick modal panel popup renderings, and all the new stuff from Hanami. Also, there are a number of issues concerning this evolution towards being a full notebook, that I'd appreciate feedback on. Or feel free to open new issues if you have other thoughts or 'want to haves' you would like to record.
